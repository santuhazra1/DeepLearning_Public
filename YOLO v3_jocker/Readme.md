Tried to train joker in YOLO v3 as an EVA assignment. I have trained YOLO v3 for joker with 188 samples from the movie screenshot and trained it 
for 2000 epochs. Some false positive detection are their as no of samples are very less and trained only for 2000 epochs. 
Result could have been better with more no of samples and more epochs.

Also, please find the below attached link for data:
